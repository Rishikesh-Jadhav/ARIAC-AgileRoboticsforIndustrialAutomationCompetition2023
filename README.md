### Here are some highlights of our work:

#### Task 1: Material Handling

In this challenge, our robotic system demonstrated exceptional material handling capabilities. We successfully picked and placed objects from conveyor belts **dynamically** and bins to complete kitting tasks with high precision and efficiency, showcasing our advanced control algorithms.

#### Task 2: Assembly

Our package excelled in the assembly task, where the gantry robot required to assemble complex components. Through meticulous planning and real-time feedback using sensors, we achieved perfect assembly accuracy in the competition.

#### Task 3: Quality Inspection

Quality inspection is crucial in manufacturing, and our robotic vision system shone in this area. Our package was agile enough to call the services for performing QI to get rid of defective parts and replace them before completing the task. 

## Agility Challenges

The ARIAC competition presented several Agility challenges, including:

1. **Faulty Parts Challenge**: The Faulty Parts Challenge revolves around detecting and managing parts that are deemed unsuitable for use in the competition. The primary objective is to leverage the quality checker service to identify faulty parts and subsequently replace them with new ones.
Within our system, the handling of faulty parts is accomplished by initiating quality checks before any parts are placed on Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). If a part is identified as faulty during this process, it is promptly substituted with either an exact matching part or an appropriate alternative. This meticulous approach guarantees that faulty parts do not compromise the overall quality of the assembled kits.

2. **High-priority Orders Challenge**: The High-priority Orders Challenge requires participants to fulfill a high-priority order ahead of a low-priority order. In this scenario, the Central Control System (CCS) plays a critical role in identifying high-priority orders and swiftly transitioning between tasks.
To effectively manage high-priority orders within our package, we maintain two distinct vectors: one for high-priority orders and another for low-priority orders. When a high-priority order is introduced, it is given immediate precedence, and our system is configured to prioritize its execution before addressing low-priority tasks. This prioritization ensures the timely completion of high-priority orders, aligning with the challenge's requirements.

3. **Insufficient Parts Challenge**: The Insufficient Parts Challenge replicates scenarios in which the work cell confronts a shortage of components required to fulfill one or more orders. In this challenge, the Central Control System (CCS) faces the task of recognizing insufficient parts and responding appropriately, which may involve employing alternative parts or submitting orders in an incomplete state.
Our approach to addressing the Insufficient Parts Challenge revolves around the use of an unordered map to meticulously monitor part quantities and their specific locations within the work cell. When the CCS detects a shortage of required parts, the system proactively identifies available alternatives or parts of different colors that can be utilized to ensure order completion without unnecessary delays. This strategic handling of resource shortages optimizes the efficiency of our system when facing the challenge of insufficient parts.

4. **Flipped Parts Challenge**: Flipped parts were the parts upside down. Our CCS had the capability of flipping these parts to the correct orientation. We used both the gantry and floor robot for this task.

5. **Dynamic Pick and Place from Conveyor Belt**: In the context of dynamic pick and place operations from a continuously moving conveyor belt, our system incorporates a sophisticated approach that takes into account the relative velocity between the floor robot and the parts on the conveyor. This method plays a pivotal role in ensuring the precise calculation of pickup zones, thereby facilitating the seamless and efficient retrieval of parts directly from the conveyor. This dynamic approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of our pick and place processes when dealing with items in motion on the conveyor belt.

## Architecture

The project's architecture revolves around pick-and-place tasks, specifically kitting and assembly, with the possibility of combined tasks. Here's an overview:

- **Kitting**: The robot identifies parts on a conveyor belt using an Advanced Logical Camera. These parts are picked up by the floor robot and placed in bins (empty slots). Empty trays are picked up using a tray gripper and placed on Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). The parts from the bins are placed on the trays based on kitting requirements, and AGVs transport them to the assembly destination, taking agility challenges like high-priority orders and faulty parts into account.

- **Assembly**: In the assembly process, the ceiling robot picks up parts from the tray and inserts them into their respective slots.

- **Combined**: This represents a combination of both kitting and assembly tasks, with the floor robot performing kitting tasks and the ceiling robot executing assembly tasks.

## Order Parsing and Processing

Orders are received and stored in vectors based on their priority. The `RoboCircus` node processes these orders, ensuring the sufficiency of parts and completing tasks as efficiently as possible. When parts are insufficient, a replacement strategy is applied, either using exact replacements or alternative parts.

## Sensors and Cameras

Sensors and cameras play a vital role in detecting part type, color, and location within the environment. Different cameras, including RGB and Basic Logical Cameras, are used to provide information about parts' characteristics and positions. A perception pipeline involving HSV masking is used to determine part color and type.

## Difficulties Encountered

Throughout the project, several challenges and difficulties were encountered, including issues with order handling, dynamic pick-and-place tasks, and quality checker service limitations. However, the team effectively addressed these challenges by fine-tuning algorithms, implementing resource management techniques, and ensuring robustness in the code. The final demo showcased the team's problem-solving skills and efficient coordination, resulting in a successful demonstration and a full score.

In summary, this project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to tackling the ARIAC competition challenges, combining innovative solutions, efficient algorithms, and effective communication between nodes to achieve agile robotic performance in an industrial environment.

Our collective efforts, innovative solutions, and relentless pursuit of excellence allowed us to secure a prominent position in the ARIAC competition during [Year]. We look forward to continuing our journey in the field of industrial automation and robotics.
